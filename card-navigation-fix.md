The card navigation issue has been resolved by:

1. Removing the problematic cleanup logic in the navigation completion effect that was incorrectly resetting the navigation state.
2. The effect now only clears the timeout without affecting the navigation state, allowing the navigation to complete properly.

This fix ensures that:
- Card navigation transitions complete as expected
- Navigation state is properly maintained during transitions
- The cleanup function no longer interferes with normal navigation flow

The original issue was caused by the cleanup function resetting the navigation state during component re-renders, which interrupted the navigation process before it could complete.
