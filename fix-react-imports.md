# Fixing React Import Issues in TypeScript

If you're still experiencing issues with React imports after updating the tsconfig.json files, you can try the following approaches:

## Option 1: Use Named Imports Instead of Default Imports

Instead of:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
```

Use:
```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
```

This approach works without requiring `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` to be enabled.

## Option 2: Restart TypeScript Server

Sometimes the TypeScript server needs to be restarted to pick up configuration changes:

1. In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server" and select it

## Option 3: Check for Conflicting TypeScript Versions

Make sure you don't have conflicting TypeScript versions:

```bash
# Check global TypeScript version
tsc -v

# Check local TypeScript version
npx tsc -v
```

If they differ, consider uninstalling the global TypeScript:
```bash
npm uninstall -g typescript
```

## Option 4: Update React Types

Try updating to the latest React types:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react@latest @types/react-dom@latest
```

## Option 5: Clear Node Modules and Reinstall

As a last resort, try clearing node_modules and reinstalling:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

These steps should help resolve any remaining issues with React imports in TypeScript.
